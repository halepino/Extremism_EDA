# Correlates of Extremism

### Author: https://github.com/halepino

### Overview  
This project explores correlates of extremist attitudes. Likert questions aimed at capturing these attitudes are based on J.M. Berger’s extensive writings on the topic. His work explains extreme attitudes (political, racial, religious etc) all relate to perceptions of in-groups and out groups. In the extreme, people come to believe the “success of us is inseparable from hostile acts against them”.
